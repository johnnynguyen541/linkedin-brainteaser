# Problem Statement

Jen invited some people to join her LinkedIn network. Some of them invited new people, who invited new people, and so on. Now there are N people in the network, numbered from 1 to N. Jen has decided to remove some people and keep others. There is one restriction: when removing a person, she will also remove the people she invited, and the people they invited, and so on. Jen will never remove herself, and we do not allow people to be invited by more than one person. Jen can also decide to not remove anyone. How many different sets of people can be removed?
